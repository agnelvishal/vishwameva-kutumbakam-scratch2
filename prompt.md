My header is defaulting to white. Please update the CSS to force the background color using the specific color values from my theme.

Override Background: Apply background-color: rgba(var(--color_11), 1) !important; to the header.

Disable Overrides: Ensure that --screenwidth-corvid-background-color is not overriding this. You can do this by setting the header background directly rather than using the complex variable string.


Remove Transparency: Make sure there are no other properties like opacity: 0 or background: transparent affecting the header."
